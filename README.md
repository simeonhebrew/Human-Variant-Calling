# **Human Variant Calling**

Hello and Welcome! I am very pleased to have you around.

The above repository contains various workflows by which we could be able to 
perform Human variant calling analysis on sequence data.

The workflows will be implemented with the three most common 
workflow systems:
1. Snakemake
2. Nextflow
3. Galaxy

For the data, we shall be using the dataset provided by [H3ABioNet](https://www.h3abionet.org/) 
which can be found [here](http://h3data.cbio.uct.ac.za/assessments/NextGenVariantCalling/practice/H3A_VarCall_TestData.2017.zip).
